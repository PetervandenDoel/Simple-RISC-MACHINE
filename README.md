Simple RISC machine

This project was a collaborative effort with another UBC student

This is a simple RISC computer written in synthesizable verilog that can execute ARM assembly instructions with 16 bit encodings. The instructions are read from an initialized memory and executed in order.
The instruction encodings are as follows

MOV with an immediate operand  

MOV with a bit shifted operand  

ADD with a bit shifted operand  

CMP with a bit shifted operand  

AND with a bit shifted operand  

MVN with a bit shifted operand  

LDR with an immediate operand offset to the base adress  

STR with an immediate operand offset to the base adress  

HALT instruction to stop the execution of instructions and updating of the program counter
